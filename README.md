# Azure-Consent-Review
This PowerShell script connects to Microsoft Graph, retrieves a specified Azure AD user's OAuth2 permission grants, and lists the applications, granted permissions, consent type, and expiry time. It ensures error handling for missing users, empty grants, and unknown apps, making it ideal for security audits and compliance checks.
